# SRW Engine MV User Manual V2.0

**NOTE: As of engine version v3.0 it is no longer possible to edit Pilot, Mech and Weapon properties using meta data tags, please see below for info on how to migrate an older version project and how to access the new editor.**

# Migrating a project from before v3.0

If you have a project from before v3.0, where custom editors for Pilots, Mechs and Weapons were introduced, please run the game once and opt-in to the automatic upgrade process. All your definitions will be upgraded to the latest format.

Then download the latest default assets bundle and extract it into the projects' root directory.

# Set-up

Extract the archive containing the sample project.<br>
In the project directory navigate to js/plugins/config and copy the "default" directory into a new "active" directory.
  
# Deploying a game

To deploy a release build of a SRW Engine MV game take the following steps:

* In RPG Maker select File > Deployment
	- **DO NOT** Exclude unused files
	- **DO NOT** enable encryption	

# Terrain

This engine reuses some properties of terrain available in vanilla RPG Maker to assign additional terrain functionality.

## Terrain Cost

The terrain cost of a tile determines how many tiles of movement will be subtracted when a unit moves over it. By default each tile traveled uses up one unit of tile movement but if a tile has a higher cost assigned, additional movement will be spent to cross the tile.<br>

The terrain cost is set using the Terrain Tag functionality of RPG maker. To access this functionality in the editor go to Tools>Database>Tilesets. Select a tile set and click on the Terrain Tag option. 

![](img/terrain_tags.png)

Each tile can be assigned a Terrain Tag between zero and seven. A value of seven means seven additional tiles of movement will be subtracted for moving over the tile and a value of zero means no additional cost will be incurred for moving over the tile.

Terrain Cost will not be applied to units that are in a flying state.

## Regions

Regions are given additional importance when using SRW Engine MV.<br>
Regions are used to assign one of the five terrain types to every tile of a map. When using the region editor each region id in a column will make a tile the same terrain, only the first five columns are used.

* Column 1: Not passable (id 0, 8, 16, etc.)
* Column 2: Air (id 1, 9, 17, etc.)
* Column 3: Land (id 2, 10, 18, etc.)
* Column 4: Sea (id 3, 11, 19, etc.)
* Column 5: Space (id 4, 12, 20, etc.)

Additionally the engine provides a plugin command(addMapRegionHighlight) to highlight all tiles of a region on the map and provides a script command(isActorInRegion, isEnemyInRegion) to check if an enemy or ally is currently in a specific region. See the section on Event Scripting for more into on these commands.

Example map:

![](img/map_sample.png)

Note the use of region id 10 to create a separate area of the map that is still Land terrain but that can be highlighted separately from the other Land terrain.

## Terrain bonuses

**!!It is generally easier to use the addRegionAttributes plugin command instead of modifying the tileset metadata!!**

Any tile in a tileset can be given modifiers for evasion, defense, HP regen and EN regen for units that stand on tiles of that type.<br>

Assigning these bonuses to a tile is done using metadata tags in the Note field of the tileset in the database.

![](img/tileset_notes.png)

Only tiles in tilesets A1-A5 and B are supported.<br>

There are two formats for the metadata. In this example the attributes assigned are: an increase of 5% to defense, and increase of 10% to evasion, 15% HP restored at the start of each turn and 20% EN restored at the start of each turn.

* \<srwTileAttributes2:5, 10, 15, 20\>: assigns attributes to tile id 2
* \<srwTileAttributes3008-3056:5, 10, 15, 20\>: assigns attributes to tile id 3008 up to but not including tile id 3056

The latter of the two formats is useful for assigning properties to autotiles.


For a detailed explanation on how to figure out the tile id of a tile [please refer to this tutorial.](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/how-to-determine-your-tileid.91129/)


# Pilots

## General Notes

When making pilots it is important to remember that enemy and ally pilots should always be completely separate.<br>

If you have a character that appears as both throughout your game you must give them an entry as both an Ally and Enemy pilot.

## Ally Pilots

Launch the game and on the title screen hit F11 to access the built-in editor.

#### Base stats

* SP: is used to cast Spirit Commands.<br>
* Melee: Determines damage for Melee attacks.<br>
* Ranged: Determines damage for Ranged attacks.<br>
* Skill: Determines how often the until will perform a critical hit and how often a unit will take a critical hit.<br>
* Defense: Determines how much damage a unit takes.<br>
* Evade: Determines how likely enemy attacks are to hit.<br>
* Hit: Determines the unit's hit rate when attacking targets.<br>
* Terrain: Air, Sea, Land, Space. Determines the pilot's performance on these terrains.<br>
* Exp. yield: The exp yield listed here is the exp gained if the enemy defeated and the actor were at the same level. When the level is different the exp gain gets scaled accordingly.<br>
* PP yield: The amount of Pilot Points awarded for shooting down this unit.<br>
*  Tags:  Freeform tags applied to the pilot separated by commas. Can be used for battle text or for applying abilities.<br>


#### Stat growth rates



* A flat rate stat growth, at any given level the stat is calculated as: base\_stat + floor(level * growth\_rate) <br>
* A curve stat growth. The first parameter defines the stat's value at level 99 and the second parameter defines the growth rate. Growth rate is a value between -1 and 1, where -1 is fast growth and 
1 slow growth. <br>


#### Spirits

A pilot can have up to 6 spirits.<br>


#### Abilities

The ability learn list defines which abilities a pilot learns and at which level.

#### Personality

A pilot's personality determines how their Will changes when certain events occur. 


#### Relationships

Pilots can have certain relationships towards other pilots, these relationships will grant bonuses to the pilot when adjacent to those other pilots. The other pilots listed are the recipients of the bonuses, the unit itself does not receive any bonuses.


The effects of the relationship types are defined in RelationshipBonuses.conf.js

Ex.:

```
this.addDefinition(
	0, //the id of the bonus
	"Love", //the name of the bonus
	"Increases damage with level.", //the description of the bonus 
	function(actor, level){ //a function defining the effects granted by the bonus for each level
		var effects = [
			[{type: "final_damage", modType: "mult", value: 1.04}],
			[{type: "final_damage", modType: "mult", value: 1.08}],
			[{type: "final_damage", modType: "mult", value: 1.12}],
		];
		return effects[level];
	}
);

```

The setPilotRelationship plugin command can be used to update a pilot's relationships. 

## Enemy Pilots

Launch the game and on the title screen hit F11 to access the built-in editor. The properties are the same as for Ally Pilots.

# Mechs

## General Notes

Unlike in vanilla RPG Maker, the Class/Mech of the unit is what determines what their sprite will be on the map.

When working with Mechs a couple of important things must be kept in mind:

* Enemy and Ally Mechs must be kept separate at all times. If a Mech appears as both an Ally and Enemy unit in the game a separate entry must be made for when it used as an Ally and when it is used as an Enemy. 
* Never assign multiple Allied Pilots to the same Mech entry. If multiple copies of the same Mech need to be used by allied pilots, each copy must have its own entry. This restriction does not apply to Enemy mechs.

## Definition

Launch the game and on the title screen hit F11 to access the built-in editor.

### Base stats

* Primary Attribute: The primary attribute of the mech, used if ENABLE\_ATTRIBUTE\_SYSTEM is on.<br>
* Secondary Attribute: The secondary attribute of the mech, used if ENABLE\_ATTRIBUTE\_SYSTEM is on.<br>
* HP<br>
* EN: EN is consumed to perform some attacks.<br>
* Armor: Determines how much damage the mech takes from enemy attacks.<br>
* Mobility: Determines how likely the mech is to be hit by enemy attacks.<br>
* Accuracy: Determines how likely the mech is to hit enemies.<br>
* Terrain: Air,Land,Sea,Space. Determines the mech's performance on these terrains.<br>
* Move: Determines how many tiles the mech can move by default.<br>

* Size: Determines the size of the mech, which influences evasion and damage taken.<br>
* CanFly
* AirEnabled
* LandEnabled
* WaterEnabled: By default a unit will still only have half movement in water. Set it to "without penalty" option to give the units full movement in water.
* SpaceEnabled
* ExpYield: The exp yield listed here is the exp gained if the enemy defeated and the actor were at the same level. When the level is different the exp gain gets scaled accordingly.<br>
* PPYield<br>
* FundYield<br>
* Tags: Freeform tags applied to the mech separated by commas. Can be used for battle text or for applying abilities.<br>

### Upgrade costs

The upgrade costs for a mech's stats can be one of multiple types. The type defines how much each level of upgrades costs.

Cost types are defined in Engine.conf. Types are separate between regular stats and weapon upgrades.

### Upgrade amounts

For normal stats, upgrades will increase the stat by a fixed value for each level of upgrades. The defaults are:

HP: 350<br>
EN: 10<br>
Armor: 60<br>
Mobility: 5<br>
Accuracy: 6<br>

For weapons the upgrade amount per level is defined in the Weapon definition.


### Transform

Note: Transformation functionality is currently only available for Ally units.

Units can be given the ability to transform into other units.

Units can be given the ability to automatically transform into other units when they are destroyed.


Units can be given the ability to automatically transform into other units if another unit is present or missing on the map.  


### Combining Units

Units can be given the ability to combine into other units. Combined units have the ability to split back into their components. The combine command will be available in the unit menu if all required units are adjacent on the map.


### Inheriting upgrades and parts

When working with transforming or combining mechs it usually desirable for the upgrade levels of the transformed or combined mech to match those of the base mech and for parts to be synchronized as well.

Set the Sync With of a unit to sync its upgrades with another unit.


### Managing (Sub)Pilot Assignments 

Only applies to allied units.

Some mechs may be pilot-able by multiple pilots. Set the Allowed Pilots to defined which pilots these are.

A mech can have any number of sub-pilots. The spirit commands of the sub-pilots are usable by the unit as a whole.
The pilots listed in the database definition are the default sub-pilots for a unit.

Each sub pilot slot can be assigned a list of valid pilots. Up to 10 slots are supported:


Fore Pilots: If enabled the sub-pilots of the mech will always be set to the ones defined by the sub pilots tag. This property should be set on mechs that have sub-pilots that can be assigned to different units so that it will always have the correct sub-pilots when deployed.

### Deployment

#### Actions

Some mechs need to make sure pilots are in the correct spot before they can be used.

Set deploy actions to manage automatic pilot reassignments.

### Attacks

The attacks available to the mech. If locked the weapon will not show up in the weapon list be default.

### Abilities

A Mech can have up to 6 abilities and Full Upgrade Bonus ability.


### Items

A mech can have 1-4 item slots. An enemy mech will drop all items it is holding for the player to collect when defeated. The items held by enemies are defined when spawning the enemy.

### Sprite info 

Image files for the battle scene are stored in the img/SRWBattleScene directory with a sub directory for each character. The directory for each character contains a main.png image which is the image that is used for the Mech in the battle scene.

Settings are managed in the Battle Scene section of the Mech editor.

* Folder: The name of the sub directory in the img/SRWBattleScene folder that houses the image files for the Mech. <br>
* Sprite Type: Default, Spriter or Dragonbones
* Source Size: The height and width of the main.png image for this mech in pixels.<br>
* Y offset: If specified the main sprite for the unit will be offset by the given amount. The offset is specified in world units.
* Shadow Scale: The size of the shadow displayed for the mech in the battle scene.<br>
* Shadow Z Offset: The z offset for the shadow relative to the center point of the mech's sprite in the battle scene in world units.<br>
* Shadow X Offset: The x offset for the shadow relative to the center point of the mech's sprite in the battle scene in world units.<br>
* World Size The world space size of the Mech's sprite. This size is used for determining the size and position of the unit's barrier.<br>
* Death Animation: Specifies the id of a battle animation to be played when the mech is destroyed. If omitted the default death animation is used.

Each mech should have an image file for the default poses in its SRWBattleScene folder.
The required default poses are:

    main: Idle pose
    in: Leaning in while moving
    out: Leaning back while moving
    hurt
    dodge

For units that use regular sprites each of these default poses should have a matching .png file in the correct character folder(main.png, hurt.png, etc.)

### Basic Battle Sprite

Click the preview in the Basic Battle section to choose the basic battle sprite. Stored in img/basic_battle.

### Map Sprite

Click the preview in the Overworld section to choose the map sprite. Stored in img/characters in standard RPG Maker format.

### Menu Sprite

A separate menu sprite can be selected for a unit, the main battle scene sprite is used by default.
Click the sprite in the General Info section to select a menu sprite. If the default Sprite is being used "Using fallback!" will be shown below the Sprite preview.

### Spawn Animation

* Animation The name of the sprite sheet found in img/animations<br>
* Frame Size The width and height of the frames of the animation in pixels<br>
* Frames: The number of animation frames to use from the sprite sheet<br>
* Sheet Width: The width in frames of the sprite sheet<br>
* Animation Speed: The speed of the animation in frames spent for each frame of the animation<br>
* Change on frame: The frame of the animation on which the unit that is being spawned will become visible<br>
* Sound effect The sound effect that plays when spawning the unit<br>

### Destroy Animation

* Animation The name of the sprite sheet found in img/animations<br>
* Frame Size The width and height of the frames of the animation in pixels<br>
* Frames: The number of animation frames to use from the sprite sheet<br>
* Sheet Width: The width in frames of the sprite sheet<br>
* Animation Speed: The speed of the animation in frames spent for each frame of the animation<br>
* Change on frame: The frame of the animation on which the unit that is being spawned will become invisible<br>
* Sound effect The sound effect that plays when spawning the unit<br>


# Attacks

## Definition

Launch the game and on the title screen hit F11 to access the built-in editor.


* Animation: The battle scene attack animation id that will be played for this weapon. If no id is provided the default animation will play.<br>
* Type Ranged or Melee<br>
* Post Move: Enable to allow the weapon to be used after moving<br>
* Power<br>
* Min Range<br>
* Range:<br>
* HitMod: Boost to hit rate in percent<br>
* CritMod: Boost to crit rate in percent<br>
* Ammo: Total ammo for the weapon, -1 if the weapon does not use ammo<br>
* EN: EN cost for using the weapon, -1 if the weapon does not have a cost<br>
* Will: Will requirement for the weapon, -1 if there is no requirement<br>
* Terrain: If a terrain value is "-" the weapon cannot be used on enemies who are currently on a tile of that terrain.<br>

* The weapon upgrade type determines how much power the weapon gains when upgraded.
* Category: The particle type of the weapon: ex: missile, funnel, beam, gravity, physical. Can be any value.	
* Always counter: If enabled the weapon will always trigger a Counter on the enemy turn. <br>
* IsCounterOnly:  If enabled the weapon can only be used to counter attack. <br>
* HPThreshold: If set this weapon will only be usable when the user's HP falls below the specified value(percent). This property is also respected by the enemy AI.<br>
* IsAll:  If enabled this weapon is treated as an ALL weapon and will hit both targets when targeting a twin. A note will be shown in the attack list to identify the weapon as an ALL weapon.
* Primary Attribute: Used if ENABLE\_ATTRIBUTE\_SYSTEM is on. If defined it will be used instead of the attacking mechs primary attribute.<br>
* Secondary Attribute:Used if ENABLE\_ATTRIBUTE\_SYSTEM is on. If defined it will be used instead of the attacking mechs secondary attribute.<br>
 
Weapons can have up to 10 special effects.

If a weapon has a map attack Id assigned it will function as map attack, other wise it functions as a normal attack.

## Combinations Attacks

Combinations attacks are attacks that require other units with a matching attack to either be adjacent to the current attacker or present on the field before the attack can be used. When a Combination Attack is used all participants will take the EN or ammo cost for the attack.

If any combo weapons are defined the attack is treated as a Combo Attack.

A combination attack has the following properties:

* Type: If "Adjacent" the attack can only be used if units with all required combo weapons are adjacent to each other and the attacker. If "On Map" the other units can be anywhere on the map.<br>

* Required Weapons: Thee other weapons that are required for the attack. Only one weapon can be provide per unit, so if two weapons are required then 2 units will need to be available to provide them.

## MAP Attacks

Map attacks can be managed through the Weapon editor by selecting a map attack and clicking the Edit button in the Map Attack section.


# Spirit Commands

Spirit commands are buff, debuff and healing commands that units can use when taking their turn, but only before moving. Spirit commands can apply to the own unit, another ally, an enemy, all allies or all enemies. Spirit commands consume SP to be used, but the cost is not part of the base definition and is instead defined when they are assigned to a Pilot. This allows Spirit commands to have different costs depending on the user.

Spirit commands are managed in: js/plugins/config/active/Spirits.conf.js

[A list of default Spirit commands is available here.](default_spirits.md)


The format of a Spirit command definition is as follows:

```javascript
this.addDefinition(
		0, //the id of the spirit
		"Love", //the display name of the spirit
		"Commands Accel, Strike, Alert, Valor, Spirit, Gain and Fortune will take effect.", //the display description of the spirit
		function(target){ //the effect function of the spirit, target is the actor that will be affected by the spirit command
			$statCalc.modifyWill(target, 10);
			$statCalc.setSpirit(target, "accel");
			$statCalc.setSpirit(target, "strike");
			$statCalc.setSpirit(target, "alert");
			$statCalc.setSpirit(target, "valor");
			$statCalc.setSpirit(target, "spirit");
			$statCalc.setSpirit(target, "gain");
			$statCalc.setSpirit(target, "fortune");
		},
		"self", //the targeting type of the spirit: self, ally, ally_all or enemy_all
		function(actor){ //this function is used to determine if the spirit can be used
			var activeSpirits = $statCalc.getActiveSpirits(actor);
			return ( 
				$statCalc.canWillIncrease(actor) ||
				!activeSpirits.accel ||
				!activeSpirits.strike ||







				!activeSpirits.alert ||
				!activeSpirits.valor ||
				!activeSpirits.spirit ||
				!activeSpirits.gain ||
				!activeSpirits.fortune
			);
		}, 
		null, //this function is used to determine if the spirit can be used for any target. Only applicable for "ally" type spirits
		{ // info for the animation when the spirit is used
			src: "Love", //the name of the image file in img/animations/spirits
			duration: 800 //the duration of the animation in milliseconds
		}
	)
```

# Abilities and effects

There are several types of special abilities and effects in SRW Engine MV: Pilot abilities, Mech abilities, Item effects and weapon effects.

## Pilot Abilities

Pilot abilities are managed in js/plugins/config/active/PilotAbilities.conf.js

Pilot abilities can be assigned to pilots. These abilities can have levels and can level up as the pilot levels up. For more information on assigning abilities please check the section on Pilots.<br>  
  
Pilots have a special ability called an Ace Ability that is unlocked once the pilot has shot down a certain amount of enemies. Ace Abilities are defined as regular abilities with an additional check in their isActive function to verify that the pilot has reached Ace status. 

[A list of default Pilot Abilities is available here.](default_pilot_abilities.md)


The format of a Pilot Ability definition is as follows: 

```javascript
	this.addDefinition(
		4, //the id of the ability
		"Prevail", // the display name of the ability
		"Hit, Evade, Armor and Critical go up as HP decreases.", // the display description of the ability 
		true, // true if the ability has a level, otherwise false
		false, //true if the ability is unique, otherwise false. Unique abilities are marked with a \* when they are display and they cannot be purchased
		function(actor, level){//the function implementing the effect of the ability. Actor is the unit that will be affected by the ability and level is the current level of the ability.
			var mechStats = $statCalc.getCalculatedMechStats(actor);		
			var targetSlice = Math.floor(mechStats.currentHP / mechStats.maxHP * 10);
			var hitEvadeMod = (level - targetSlice) * 0.05;
			if(hitEvadeMod < 0){
				hitEvadeMod = 0;
			}
			var armorMod = (level - targetSlice) * 0.1;
			if(armorMod < 0){
				armorMod = 0;
			}
			var critMod = (level - targetSlice) * 0.08;
			if(armorMod < 0){
				armorMod = 0;
			}
			return [
				{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: hitEvadeMod * 100},
				{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: hitEvadeMod * 100},
				{type: "armor", modType: "addPercent", value: armorMod},
				{type: "crit", modType: "addFlat", value: critMod * 100},
			];
		},// the function that determines if the ability is current active.
		function(actor, level){
			var mechStats = $statCalc.getCalculatedMechStats(actor);	
			var targetSlice = Math.floor(mechStats.currentHP / mechStats.maxHP * 10);
			return (targetSlice + 1) <= level;
		},
		[20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100],// the cost for upgrading each level of the ability.
		9// the max level of the ability.
		, // the function that determines how the ability's name should be displayed. If a value of "on" is returned the ability's name will be displayed with a blue highlight, if a value of "off" is returned the name will be grayed out. For any other returned value the name will be displayed with the default color.
		function(actor, level){
			var mechStats = $statCalc.getCalculatedMechStats(actor);	
			var targetSlice = Math.floor(mechStats.currentHP / mechStats.maxHP * 10);
			return (targetSlice + 1) <= level ? "on" : "off";
		}
	)
```

By default an ability will only affect its holder, but an ability can be set to target allies and enemies in a range around the ability holder as well.

The following example implements the commander ability:

```
	this.addDefinition(
		44, //the id of the ability
		"Commander", // the display name of the ability
		"Grants a boost to evasion and accuracy to adjacent allies. Range and effectiveness depend on the skill level.", // the display description of the ability 
		true, // true if the ability has a level, otherwise false
		true, //true if the ability is unique, otherwise false. Unique abilities are marked with a \* when they are display and they cannot be purchased
		function(actor, level){ //the function implementing the effect of the ability. Actor is the unit that will be affected by the ability and level is the current level of the ability.
			var effects = [
				[//level 1
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 10, range: 1},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 10, range: 1},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 8, range: 2},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 8, range: 2},
				],
				[//level 2
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 15, range: 1},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 15, range: 1},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 12, range: 2},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 12, range: 2},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 8, range: 3},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 8, range: 3},

				],
				[//level 3
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 20, range: 1},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 20, range: 1},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 16, range: 2},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 16, range: 2},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 12, range: 3},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 12, range: 3},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 8, range: 4},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 8, range: 4},
				],
				[//level 4
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 25, range: 1},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 25, range: 1},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 20, range: 2},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 20, range: 2},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 15, range: 3},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 15, range: 3},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 10, range: 4},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 10, range: 4},
					{type: "hit", modType: "addFlat", value: 5, range: 5},{type: "evade", modType: "addFlat", value: 5, range: 5},
				],
			];
			
			return effects[level-1];
		},
		function(actor, level){ // the function that determines if the ability is current active.
			return true;
		},
		[0],//cost
		4,//max level
		null,//ability highlighting function, unused for this ability
		function(actor, level){//function that determines the range of the ability depending on level
			return {min: 1, max: 5, targets: "own"}
		},
		false //optional parameter, if false do not allow stacking of the ability with other instances of itself. Default true.
	);
``` 

And this example implements the Pressure ability:

```
	this.addDefinition(
		59, //the id of the ability
		"Pressure", // the display name of the ability
		"Increases damage dealt to and reduces damage taken from opponents within range whose SKL stats are lower. Effective range is twice the skill level. More effective at higher skill levels.", // the display description of the ability 
		true,// true if the ability has a level, otherwise false
		true, //true if the ability is unique, otherwise false. Unique abilities are marked with a \* when they are display and they cannot be purchased
		function(actor, level){ //the function implementing the effect of the ability. Actor is the unit that will be affected by the ability and level is the current level of the ability.
			var effects = [
				[//level 1
					{type: "final_damage", modType: "mult", value: 0.95}, {type: "final_defend", modType: "mult", value: 0.95},				
				],
				[//level 2
					{type: "final_damage", modType: "mult", value: 0.90}, {type: "final_defend", modType: "mult", value: 0.90},		
				],
				[//level 3
					{type: "final_damage", modType: "mult", value: 0.85}, {type: "final_defend", modType: "mult", value: 0.85},
				],
				[//level 4
					{type: "final_damage", modType: "mult", value: 0.80}, {type: "final_defend", modType: "mult", value: 0.80},
				],
			];			
			return effects[level-1];		
		},
		function(actor, level){
			var combatInfo = $statCalc.getActiveCombatInfo(actor);
			if(combatInfo){
				var ownPilotStats = $statCalc.getCalculatedPilotStats(combatInfo.self);
				var otherPilotStats = $statCalc.getCalculatedPilotStats(combatInfo.other);
				return ownPilotStats.skill > otherPilotStats.skill;
			} else {
				return false;
			}
		},
		[0],//cost
		4,//max level
		null,//ability highlighting function, unused for this ability
		function(actor, level){//function that determines the range of the ability depending on level			
			return {min: 1, max: (level*1 + 1) * 2, targets: "other"}
		}	
	);
```

## Mech Abilities

Mech abilities are managed in js/plugins/config/active/MechAbilities.conf.js

Mech Abilities are assigned to mechs and are normally part of the mech definition and cannot be changed. For more information on how Mech abilities are assigned please see the section on Mechs.

Mechs have a special ability called a Full Upgrade Bonus which is unlocked when a mech is fully upgraded. Full Upgraded Bonuses are defined in the same way as regular mech abilities but they have an additional check in their isActive function to verify that a unit is fully upgraded.

[A list of default Mech Abilities is available here.](default_mech_abilities.md)


The format of a Mech Ability definition is as follows:

```javascript
	this.addDefinition(
		0, // the id of the ability
		"Double Image", // the display name of the ability
		"30% chance to evade any attack above 130 Will.", // the display description of the ability
		false, // unused
		false, // unused
		function(actor, level){ //the function implementing the effect of the ability.
			return [{type: "double_image_rate", modType: "addFlat", value: 0.3}];
		},
		function(actor, level){ // the function that determines if the ability is current active.
			return $statCalc.getCurrentWill(actor) >= 130;
		}, // the function that determines how the ability's name should be displayed. If a value of "on" is returned the ability's name will be displayed with a blue highlight, if a value of "off" is returned the name will be grayed out. For any other returned value the name will be displayed with the default color.
		function(actor, level){
			return $statCalc.getCurrentWill(actor) >= 130 ? "on" : "off";
		}
	);

```

## Item Effects






Item effects are managed in js/plugins/config/active/ItemEffects.conf.js

Mechs can hold items that give them certain abilities. Some items are consumables that only apply their effect once consumed. Consumables return after a stage has been completed.

[A list of default Items is available here.](default_items.md)

The format of an Item Effect definition is as follows:

```javascript

	this.addDefinition(
		0, //the id of the item
		"Booster", // the display name of the item
		"Movement +1.", // the display description of the item
		false, // unused
		false, // true if the item is a consumable, otherwise false
		function(actor, level){ // the function implementing the effect of the item
			return [{type: "movement", modType: "addFlat", value: 1}];
		},
		function(actor, level){ // the function that determines if the item is usable, normally always returns true
			return true;
		}
	);

```

## Weapon Effects

Weapon effects are managed in js/plugins/config/active/WeaponEffects.conf.js

Weapons can have special effects that apply or that they inflict when used. 

[A list of default Weapon Effects is available here.](default_weapon_effects.md)

The format of a Weapon Effect definition is as follows:

```javascript

	this.addDefinition(
		0, // the id of the effect
		"Barrier Piercing", // the display name of the effect
		"Ignores barriers on the target.", // the display description of the effect
		false, // unused
		false, // unused
		function(actor, level){ // the function implementing the effect of the item
			return [{type: "pierce_barrier", modType: "addFlat", value: 1}];
		},
		function(actor, level){// the function that determines if the item is usable, normally always returns true
			return true;
		}
	);

```


## Ability Commands

Ability commands are managed in js/plugins/config/active/AbilityCommands.conf.js

Some pilot or mech abilities can grant the unit use of special Ability Commands. The properties of the Ability Commands are defined as follows:

```javascript

	this.addDefinition(
		0, //the id of the command
		"Chalice", //the display name of the command
		"Recover HP and EN to full up to twice per stage.", //the display description of the command
		2, //the number of times the ability can be used per stage
		function(actor){ //the function that applies the effect of the command to the user
			$statCalc.recoverHPPercent(actor, 100);
			$statCalc.recoverENPercent(actor, 100);
		}, function(actor){ //the function that checks if the command can be used
			return $statCalc.canRecoverEN(actor) || $statCalc.canRecoverHP(actor)
		},
		42 //the animation that should be played when the ability is used, -1 if none
	);	
F
```

The abilities that grant use of Ability Commands use the special "ability\_command" type. These can be any type of Ability, this is an example of a Mech ability that grants use of an Ability Command as a Full Upgrade Bonus:

```javascript
	this.addDefinition(
		37, 

		"Chalice",
		"Recover HP and EN to full up to twice per stage.",
		false,
		false,
		function(actor, level){
			return [
				{type: "ability_command", cmdId: 0},				
			];
		},
		function(actor, level){
			return $statCalc.isFUB(actor);
		}
	);	
```
# Event scripting

## Stage control events

This engine introduces a couple of specific event types that will run when the engine is in a specific state.<br>
Ex.: Start of a stage, after a unit made an action, etc.<br>
They can be found at the top left of the demo stages.

![](img/main_events.png)

These events have a metadata tag indicating their type.<br>
Ex.: \<type:battleStart\><br>

It is recommended to create all new stages by creating a copy of a demo stage so that all the basics for these events are in place.

### battleStart

The battleStart event runs when the stage first starts. This event is used to set up the stage as well as to show any story events that should occur before the stage starts.<br>
It will normally have the following responsibilities:



* Set the battle environments for the map using the setDefaultBattleEnv, setSkyBattleEnv and setRegionBattleEnv commands

* Set the stage theme song using the setStageSong plugin command

* Set the enemy upgrade level using the setEnemyUpgradeLevel plugin command

* Set the stage victory, loss and mastery condition texts

* Spawn initial enemies using the this.addEnemy script command

* Play the stage BGM using the Play BGM command

* Fade in the screen from black using the FadeIn Screen command

* Showing the stage name using either a text command or by displaying an image

* Showing the stage conditions by using the this.showStageConditions script command

### actorTurn

The actorTurn event runs at the start of each actor turn. It can be used to have certain events occur at the start of a specific turn by using the Turns Passed(Stage) control variable.<br>
This command is also responsible for showing the next turn text using a formatted Text command.

### enemyTurn

The enemyTurn event runs at the start of each enemy turn. It can be used to have certain events occur at the start of a specific turn by using the Turns Passed(Stage) control variable.<br>
This command is also responsible for showing the next turn text using a formatted Text command.

### turnEnd

The turnEnd event runs at the end of a full turn (actor phase + enemy phase).

### beforeBattle

The beforeBattle event runs before each battle. The Actor Event ID, Enemy Event ID, Actor ID and Enemy ID control variables can be used to check which units are going to involved in the upcoming battle. This event can be used for before battle interactions between characters.

### beforeDestruction

The beforeDesctruction event will run after battle occurred but before any rewards are given and before any destroyed units play their destruction animations. The pending destruction of a unit can be canceled in this event. This event can be used to have bosses run away instead of being destroyed or to trigger defeat conditions if an ally unit will be destroyed.

### afterAction

The afterAction event runs every time a unit completes its turn. This is the event where checks for stage completion/loss requirements will usually will be done. It will then also contain scripting for the after stage story section, setting up deploys for the next stage and sending the player to the Intermission map. 

## Other event types

Events that are used for units can have special roles assigned to them using metadata as well.

* \<type: ship\>: Specifies that the event will be linked to a ship type unit. These events are used when automatically deploying ship units.
* \<type: ship_event\>: Specifies that the event will become a ship through a scripted deploy during the stage. These events are not used for automatic deployment. Events that will become ships must be tagged as such to ensure that they have proper z-indexing.
* \<type: actor\>: Specifies that the event will be linked to an actor pilot. These events become selectable positions when doing a manual deploy.

## Control Variables

The first two pages of Control Variables are reserved for specific functions in the engine:

* 0001 - Remaining Actors: The number of remaining actors on the stage. This variable is updated by the engine when allies are added or removed.
* 0002 - Remaining Enemies: The number of remaining enemies on the stage. This variable is updated by the engine when enemies are added or removed.
* 0003 - Turns Passed(Stage): The number of turns(one actor phase + one enemy phase) that has passed on the current stage.
* 0004 - Actor Event ID: The event ID of the current active actor


* 0005 - Enemy Event ID: The event ID of the current active enemy
* 0006 - Next Map: The id of the next map that will be loaded after the next intermission
* 0007 - Next Map X: The starting x coordinate for the cursor on the next map
* 0008 - Next Map Y: The starting y coordinate for the cursor on the next map
* 0009 - Next Deploy Info: Information for the deployment on the next map. Should be treated as read only!
* 0010 - SR Count: The total SR points earned by the player. This needs to be updated manually by the stage script when the player completes a mastery condition
* 0011 - Last stage ID: The ID of the previous stage.
* 0012 - Turn Count(Global): The total number of turns the player has taken across all stages
* 0013 - Actor ID: The actor ID of the current active actor. **When using the twin system the isActorInBattle or isEventInBattle command must be used instead!**
* 0014 - Enemy ID: The enemy ID of the current active enemy **When using the twin system the isEnemyInBattle or isEventInBattle command must be used instead!**
* 0015 - Actors Destroyed: The number of allies that were destroyed on the current stage
* 0016 - Enemies Destroyed: The number of  
* 0017 - Mastery Condition Text
* 0018 - Victory Condition Text
* 0019 - Defeat Condition Text
* 0020 - Ship Count: The current number of active ships on the stage

Variables 0021-0060 are stageTemp variables that can be used to keep track of things over the course of a single stage.<br>
<b>The engine will automatically clear these when a new stage starts!</b>

Page 4 and 5 of the Control Variables have been made reserved for specific functions in the engine after more variables became necessary. Currently the following Variables are available:

* 0061 - lastActorAttackId: The ID of the attack used by the actor in the most recent battle.
* 0062 - lastActorSupportAttackId: The ID of the attack used by the actor support attacker in the most recent battle.
* 0063 - lastEnemyAttackId: The ID of the attack used by the enemy in the most recent battle.

* 0064 - lastEnemySupportAttackId: The ID of the attack used by the enemy support attacker in the most recent battle.

	Returns how many units are currently active of the specified faction\_id.(player => blue, 0 => red, 1 => green, 2 => yellow)
	
* this.showTextCrawl(crawl\_id, is\_cancellable)	

	Shows a text crawl of the text defined in APPSTRINGS.TEXT\_CRAWLS, identified by crawl\_id. The event script execution is halted until the text crawl completes. If is\_cancellable is true the player can skip the text crawl with the B button.
	
* this.setCustomWait()	

	Puts the script interpreter into a wait state until clearCustomWait is called.
	
* this.clearCustomWait()
	
	Clears the custom wait state if set.	
	
* this.setEventAbilityZone(event\_id, zone\_params)
	
	Creates a zone for the event with the specified id with the specified parameters. Will do nothing if no zone slots(max 8 default) are available. 
	
	Example:
	
	```  
		this.setEventAbilityZone(11,{
			pattern: 1,//the pattern defined in the pattern editor, will be centered on the actor
			abilityId: 0,//the id of the effect definition in ZoneAbilities.conf.js
			followsOwner: true,//if true the zone moves with the setter, otherwise it stays put
			color: "#FF0000",			
			phaseCount: 2,//the number of phases the zone stays active, only used if expires == true
			expires: true
		})	  
	```

* this.playBattleScene(config)

	Play an event battle scene according to the provided config. See the following example config for more information. You can also copy paste this example command and modify it. Note that the default RPG Maker script command box does not allow this many lines and you will need to put lines together to make it work. The custom scripting format does not have this limitation.
	
	```

# Plugin Config

The config for the plugins that make up SRW Engine MV lives in the js/plugins/config directory inside two folders: default and active. The default folder contains the default settings, while the active folder contains settings modified for your game if applicable. The file in the default folder is overwritten by the file in the active folder with the same name. When the engine is updated only the defaults will be changed and the files in the active folder will never be touched. So if you want to customize any of these files for your game always first copy them to the active folder and modify the version in the active folder. <br>

Some config files were already covered in previous sections where appropriate and will not be mentioned again in this section.

## Appstrings.conf.js

The localization file for the engine. This file defines in multiple subsections the strings that are used for display in the engine. This file can be updated to translate the engine to a new language or to change certain terms to ones more fitting to the game in question. 

## BattleSongs.conf.js

```javascript
$SRWConfig.battleSongs = {
	actorSongMapping: {// maps an actor id to a song. A song is defined by the name of a .ogg file in the audio/bgm folder
		1: "Battle1", //simple mapping
		3: {//mapping with weapon songs
			default: "Theme1",//used for any weapon not listed
			weapons: {//maps a weapon id to a song. A song is defined by the name of a .ogg file in the audio/bgm folder
				3: "Battle2",
				5: "Battle3"
			}

		},
	},
	enemySongMapping: {// maps an enemy id to a song. A song is defined by the name of a .ogg file in the audio/bgm folder

		5: "SRW_Boss1"
	},
	actorSongPriority: {//sets the priority of an actor's song over other songs, 1 if not listed
		1: 3
	},

	enemySongPriority: {//set the priority of an enemy's song over other songs, 0 if not listed

		5: 2
	}
};
```

## StageInfo.conf.js

Determines how a map will be displayed on the previous map section of the intermission.

```
$SRWConfig.stageInfo = {
	1: { //the id of the map
		name: "Escape", //the name shown for the map
		displayId: 1 //the stage number shown for the map
	},
	2: {
		name: "Reunion",
		displayId: 2
	}
}
```

## Input.conf.js

The mappings between key and button codes to internal function ids. 

```
Input.keyMapper = {
	8: 'select', //backspace
	9: 'tab',       // tab
	13: 'menu',       // enter
	16: 'shift',    // shift
	17: 'control',  // control
	18: 'control',  // alt
	27: 'escape',   // escape
	32: 'ok',       // space
	33: 'pageup',   // pageup
	34: 'pagedown', // pagedown
	37: 'left',     // left arrow
	38: 'up',       // up arrow
	39: 'right',    // right arrow
	40: 'down',     // down arrow
	45: 'escape',   // insert
	81: 'pageup',   // Q
	87: 'pagedown', // W
	88: 'escape',   // X
	90: 'ok',       // Z
	96: 'escape',   // numpad 0
	98: 'down',     // numpad 2
	100: 'left',    // numpad 4
	102: 'right',   // numpad 6
	104: 'up',      // numpad 8
	120: 'debug',    // F9
	36: "left_trigger", //home

	35: "right_trigger", //end
	45: "L3"
};

Input.gamepadMapper = {
	0: 'ok',        // A

	1: 'cancel',    // B
	2: 'shift',     // X
	3: 'menu',      // Y
	4: 'pageup',    // LB
	5: 'pagedown',  // RB
	8: 'select',	// Select
	12: 'up',       // D-pad up
	13: 'down',     // D-pad down
	14: 'left',     // D-pad left
	15: 'right',    // D-pad right
	
	6: "left_trigger",
	7: "right_trigger",
	10: "L3"
};	
```

The displayed number is separate from the map id because a game might have multiple maps that appear with the same stage number due to route splits. Additionally it makes the creation order of the maps less important.

## Concept Examples

### Stage Flow

The normal flow of a SRW game will see the player go from stage to intermission to the next stage and so on.
