## Pilots

### Will
Will is a resource that a pilot gains over the course of a stage. It is reset at the start of each stage. Will boosts damage output and defense and some attacks can only be used if the pilot has enough Will. 
Will is gained at a rate of 1 per turn and additional will is rewarded to all members of a faction(ally/enemy) if an opposing unit is shot down. Pilots may also gain will for actions like evading, hitting an enemy, taking a hit, etc. according to their personality.

### Main stats
* Melee: Determines how much damage melee attacks used by the pilot will do
* Ranged: Determines how much damage ranged attacks used by the pilot will do
* Skill: Determines how often the pilot will land a critical and how often a critical will land on them. Also used as a requirement for some abilities.
* Defense: Determines how much damages the pilot's mech will take
* Evade: Determines how well the pilot dodges enemy attacks
* Hit: Determines the hit rate of attacks

### Abilities
A pilot can have up to 6 abilities. These abilities unlock through leveling up or can be purchased and equipped from the pilot upgrade menu in the intermission.

#### Ace Bonus
The Ace Bonus is a special ability a pilot gains once they become an Ace Pilot. A pilot becomes an Ace Pilot by shooting down the required amount of enemies in battle. An Ace Pilot will also deploy with a bit more Will at the start of a stage.

### Spirit Commands
Spirit commands are buffs and debuffs a pilot can use by expending SP. A pilot has up to 6 Spirit Commands. A pilot gains Spirit commands by leveling up and the cost of a command can vary by pilot.

* Accuracy: Determines the hit rate against targets
* Move: How the maximum number of tiles the mech can move per turn
* Size: S(Small), M(Medium), L(Large), LL(Extra large). The size has an effect on the damage taken and accuracy of a mech. In general a larger mech will take less damage but have worse hit and evade rates and a smaller mech will take more damage but have better evade and hit rates.

### Abilities
A mech can have up to 6 abilities. Abilities are built into the mech but additional abilities may be granted by equiping certain Parts.

### Parts

## Terrain
Terrain plays an important role in this SRPG. Each tile on the map has a certain terrain and pilots, mechs and weapons will perform better or worse depending on the terrain.

### Types
* Air
* Land
* Water
* Space

Some mechs may only be placed on certain types of terrain. Ex.: A unit that can't fly can't be placed on a tile that represents an Abyss.

### Ranking
Pilots, mechs and weapons have a ranking for each terrain that ranges from D(worst) to S(best). 

For pilots and mechs the combined terrain ranking is used:

* D + D = D
* D + C = C
* C + C = C
* C + B = B
* B + B = B
* B + A = A
* A + A = A
* A + S = A

### Bonuses
Some types of terrain may give certain bonuses to units that are on them. These bonus can be to Evasion, Defense, HP Regeneration and EN Regeneration.

# Stages
The main game play happens on grid based stages. There are separate enemy and ally turns, during a turn each unit of a faction can make a move after which the turn is passed to the next faction. 

Each stage has Victory conditions,  Defeat conditions and Mastery conditions. The mastery condition is a bonus condition that awards you with a Mastery Point when completed. The Victory and Defeat conditions may change over the course of a stage.
